# NLP_Assignement_2_3

In the code, i tried every machine learning algorithms that we saw in class to do the predictions. The purpose was to find the best fitted model for ours predictions. 

Finally, I'm not really convinced with the results but regarding the task i suppose that is due to a training set not large enough. Unfortunately i can't run more than 1000 lignes.

I invite you to add more lignes if you can run it, and see the difference of accuracies.
